#### before the project starts
- [ ] rfc connection between frontend and backend exists
- [ ] my user exists on frontend and backend server and is the same user
- [ ] my user exists in d and q and is the same

#### extend service
- [ ] create new segw-project that redefines std. OData project

#### deploy and test extension
- [ ] create customizing-task on d frontend for launchpad designer    
- [ ] create z_catalog:    A Fiori catalog can include two components:

* Tiles which represent the visual part of a tile such as a title, subtitle, information, icon and the semantic object and action for the intent-based navigation. (There is also an option with hardcoded urls, where you don't need target mappings)
* Target mappings which define the target application which is launched when an intent (semantic object/action) is triggered.
- [ ] create z_tile
- [ ] create target-mapping for tile otherwise the tile opens nothing 
>As of SAP NetWeaver 7.50 /SAP UI Add-On 2.0 navigation targets for the application types SAPUI5 Fiori apps, transactions, Web Dynpro applications and URLs can be defined completely within the SAP Fiori launchpad designer without using transaction LPD_CUST.
This is an important simplification of the target mapping configuration with an additional positive impact on the performance. Therefore, the general recommendation is to define navigation targets without using LPD_CUST.
